Notes
Wiki:
Quantifies the morphology (structural features) of three related species of iris flowers
Multivariate data set - more than 2 variables per observation
Linear Discriminant Analysis / Fisher's Linear Discriminant - a linear combination that characterises/separates two or more classes of objects.

A machine learning project may not be linear, but it has a number of well known steps:
1. Define Problem.
2. Prepare Data.
3. Evaluate Algorithms.
4. Improve Results.
5. Present Results.

The best small project to start with on a new tool is the classification of iris flowers (e.g. the iris dataset). This is a good project because it is so well understood.
* Attributes are numeric so you have to figure out how to load and handle data.
* It is a classification problem, allowing you to practice with perhaps an easier type of supervised learning algorithm.
* It is a multi-class classification problem (multi-nominal) that may require some specialized handling.
* It only has 4 attributes and 150 rows, meaning it is small and easily fits into memory (and a screen or A4 page).
* All of the numeric attributes are in the same units and the same scale, not requiring any special scaling or transforms to get started.
